            <h1>About tatoos</h1>
            <p>A tattoo is a form of body modification where a design is made by inserting ink, dyes, and/or pigments, either indelible or temporary, into the dermis layer of the skin. The art of making tattoos is tattooing. Tattoos fall into three broad categories: purely decorative (with no specific meaning); symbolic (with a specific meaning pertinent to the wearer); and pictorial (a depiction of a specific person or item). </p>
            <p>In addition, tattoos can be used for identification such as ear tattoos on livestock as a form of branding. You may be itching to get your new tattoo right away, but it takes time to get the details just right. The last thing you want is to cut corners on price or location and wind up with a shoddy tattoo — or an infection.
                Patience will pay off in the long run, so be sure to explore all of your options until you find what works for you. And if you have a great experience, your first tattoo doesn’t have to be your last! Keep adding to your canvas and embrace the confidence that it gives.</p>

                        <h4>Type of tattoos</h4>
                        <h6>1. Classic Americana</h6>
                        <p>These may be the first kind of tattoo you think of, an old-school style defined by bold outlines and the use of similar colors and imagery. They’re closely tied to the ocean and nautical imagery, pinup female figures, fierce predatory animals, or combinations of hearts, roses, and daggers. The tattoo style was popularized by Norman “Sailor Jerry” Collins in the 1930's.</p>
                        <h6>2. New school</h6>
                        <p>New School tattoos are like a crazy comic book on your body. Jesse Smith‘s work is famous in this category, depicting fabulous imagined worlds full of chaos and very often chariactured animals in vivid color.</p>
                        <h6>3. Japanese</h6>
                        <p>As we showed you in a previous post, there are centuries of history for the art tattooing all over the world. One that has maintained it’s popularity is the Japanese style Irezumi. Tattoo artists still create both traditional and new takes on these classic masterpieces. And it’s a genre particularly known for large images that cover the back, arms, and legs.</p>
                        <h6>4. Black and grey</h6>
                        <p>Black and grey images aren’t as limited by subject matter, depicting anything and everything realistically in shades of grey, originally done by watering down black ink to create a spectrum of shades.</p>
                        <h6>5. Portraiture</h6>
                        <p>Without the black outlines of some of the more classic styles, artists are able to achieve eerily accurate renditions of people both in color and black and grey.</p>
                        <h6>6. Realism</h6>
                        <p>Realistic tattoos can portray anything from scenery or objects to animals and people. Whether colorful or in black and white, this is a classic tattoo style that is ideal if there’s something very specific you want to portray. Realistic tattoos are hard to get perfectly right and it takes a skilled tattoo artist or tattoo designer to create a realistic-looking artwork with amazing visual impact.</p>
                        <h6>7. Blackwork</h6>
                        <p>Blackwork is a tattoo style originally derived from the original tribal tattoos, made of thick and bold black lines in a variety of geometric shapes. But artists continue to take this genre to new levels, incorporating patterns and imagery derived from all sorts of sources into mesmerizing pieces swirling in different forms around the body.</p>
                        <h6>8. Biomechanical</h6>
                        <p>Typically freehanded, Biomechanical tattoos adapt to the unique flow of a person’s body, meant to mimic machinery that could be hidden within the skin.</p>
                        <h6>9. Geometric</h6>
                        <p>Geometric tattoos are very popular right now and can be really timeless when done right. They can either feature geometric elements only or have a combination of geometric and organic (often floral or natural) elements. The contrast between the exact, sharp lines of this tattoo style and the curves of the body makes them stands out in a bold way.</p>
                        <h6>10. Surrealism</h6>
                        <p>The art genre of surrealism gives artists loads of material to work with. The artistic style can change, the subject can change, but as long as the viewer comes out of the experience with that feeling of sublime fantasy, the artist has achieved their purpose.</p>
